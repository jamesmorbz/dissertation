* Sortable by large usage of plugs
* 1 year max lookback, seasonality temperature
* notifcations (rule params, if cost exceeds threshold) - e.g if a pound used over a quid notify me => turn it off
* how much has a device used in the last x period - aggregated func (past day, week, month)
* never seen information on the efficiency of a device
* turn off when you cost x amount
* visualising how many plugs are on / off in a house
* notification with "tips" useful - toggle types of alerts you receive (weekly ones, daily ones, every plug changing state, categories etc.)
* log of actions useful
* generic home screen layout with drillin redirects
* settings page to edit the user's home screen layout (default date range)
* application integration paramount >> website - web based logins more painful no mobile notifs, only email notifs
* Price changes over time if variable tariff
* use average standard variable tarrif would be default but you can overwrite it with your amount - In settings enter price per kilowatt hour because you dont care about standing hour (e.g enter 22.51p/kwh)
